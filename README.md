## Junior Golang Egnineer Reqruitment Task

#### Build a middelware using 'echo' framework:

    1) Create a handler which returns response with how many days left until 2027-01-01 and HTTP 200 OK status
    2) Build a middleware which checks if HTTP header has User-Role present and contains 'admin'. If it does log to the console "red button user detected"

Think about coding standards and best practices. In general the task is about providing a working solution, but if you have time to create a good code-structure, we'd love it!

(Originally this task is supposed to be done in 1 hour)
